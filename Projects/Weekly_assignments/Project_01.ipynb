            "\n",
            "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, actually consists of two main parts:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Special Relativity (1905):** This deals with the relationship between space and time for objects moving at constant speeds in a straight line. Imagine you're on a train moving smoothly. Special relativity says:\n",
            "    *   **Time is Relative:** Time doesn't pass at the same rate for everyone. If you're on a fast-moving train, time actually passes slightly slower for you compared to someone standing still outside the train (though the difference is only noticeable at speeds close to the speed of light).\n",
            "    *   **Space is Relative:** The length of an object can also change depending on its speed relative to the observer. If you could measure the length of the same train from the outside, it would appear slightly shorter than if measured from inside (again, only noticeable at high speeds).\n",
            "    *   **The Speed of Light is Constant:** The speed of light is the same for all observers, no matter how fast they are moving. This is a key idea that leads to all the other strange effects.\n",
            "    *   **Mass and Energy are Interchangeable:** The famous equation E=mc² comes from this theory. It tells us that energy (E) and mass (m) are fundamentally the same thing and can be converted into each other. The 'c' is the speed of light, which is very big. This means that even a small amount of mass can be converted into a HUGE amount of energy.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **General Relativity (1915):** This theory expands on special relativity and incorporates gravity. Instead of thinking of gravity as a force pulling things together, general relativity says:\n",
            "    *   **Gravity is a Curving of Spacetime:** Massive objects warp or curve the fabric of spacetime around them. Imagine placing a bowling ball on a stretched rubber sheet – the sheet dips down. That's how massive objects warp spacetime.\n",
            "    *   **Objects follow the curves:** Objects move along the curved spacetime caused by massive objects. This is why planets orbit the sun, they're following the curves in spacetime caused by the sun's mass.\n",
            "    *   **Time is Affected by Gravity:** The stronger the gravity, the slower time passes. This means that time passes slightly slower at sea level compared to the top of a mountain, where gravity is slightly weaker.\n",
            "\n",
            "**In a nutshell:** Relativity says that space and time are not absolute but are relative to the observer, and gravity isn't a force but a curvature in spacetime caused by mass and energy.\n",

            "*   **Intelligent Tutoring Systems:** AI-powered tutors can provide real-time feedback, answer student questions, and guide them through complex topics, giving them more individual attention than what a single teacher can.\n",
            "*   **Automated Grading & Feedback:** AI can automate the grading of assignments and tests, saving teachers time and allowing them to focus on teaching and other tasks. AI can also provide immediate and detailed feedback to students.\n",
            "*   **Enhanced Accessibility:** AI-powered tools, such as speech recognition, text-to-speech, and real-time translation can help students with disabilities and language barriers access educational materials more effectively.\n",
            "*   **Predictive Analytics:** AI can identify students who are at risk of falling behind and allow teachers and administrators to intervene early and provide support.\n",
            "*   **Content Creation and Curation:** AI can assist teachers in creating engaging learning content and curating relevant resources, saving them time and effort.\n",
            "*   **Improved Administrative Efficiency:** AI can automate administrative tasks such as scheduling, attendance tracking, and student data management. This frees up staff time to focus on more important educational activities.\n",
            "*   **Virtual Learning Environments:** AI can create immersive virtual learning environments that allow for more interactive and engaging learning experiences.\n",
