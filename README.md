# Python:

## What is Python?
Python is a popular, beginner-friendly programming language known for its simple syntax and versatility. It's used for web development, data analysis, AI , automation, and more, because of it's readability and strong community support.

## Data types:
Python has several built-in data types that allows us to work with various kinds of data. There are two catagories of data types:

### 1. Primitive data types:
Primitive data types are used to store single values in a single variable. These data types are:

#### int:
"int" is an integer based data type, used to store all numeric values except the ones with decimal points. e.g., 1.8, 56.9879, etc.

#### float:
"float" is a floating-point based data type, which is used to store numeric values with decimal points. e.g., 4, 7, 10000, etc.

#### str:
"str" is a string data type used to store text data. e.g., "Hello World"

#### bool:
"bool" is a boolean data type used to store boolean values: True and False.

### 2. Non-Primitive data types:
Non-Primitive data types are used to store multiple values in a single variable. These data types are:

#### list:
"list" is a kind of data type, used to store mutable collection of items in ordered form.

#### tuple:
"tuple" is kind of data type, used to store immutable collection of items in ordered form.

#### dict:
"dict" is a kind of data type, used to store key-value pairs in an unordered collection.

## Use of f-strings:
"f-string" is used in print statements, to print numerical values between the text.

## Variables:
Variables are used to store data or modified throughout the program. Variables can store any kind of data type. Here are the basics of working with variables in python:

### 1. Declaring Variables:
We create a variable by simply assigning a value to a name.

### 2. Variable naming rules:
i. Variable names must start with a letter (a-z) or an underscore (_).

ii. They can not start with a number.

iii These are case sensitive (age and Age are different).

iv. Only alphanumeric and underscore are allowed (spaces and special characters are not allowed).

## Loops:
Loops are control flow statements that allows us to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. There are two main types of loops:

### For loop:
The "for" loop is used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string or range). It repeats the block of code for each item in the sequence.

### While loop:
The while loop runs as long as a specified condition is True. It keeps executing the code block until the condition becomes False.
